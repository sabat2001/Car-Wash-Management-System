# Car-Wash-Management-System
We've created a simple Car Management System that works using queues/linked lists while prompting Users to choose through a range of options to take their Order and add them to queues. This simplifies data management in a Workshop System and helps with record keeping.

Working 
• 3 Script Files; one for the Menu; then the Queues Implementation and lastly for the Orders.

• The Queue is Circular, and we’ve used a Linked List to implement it. It can be expanded freely.

• Multithreading Processing in case the current order in the queue and the next order are different wherein we can process them simultaneously- this will save processing time.
